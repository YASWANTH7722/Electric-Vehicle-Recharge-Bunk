# Electric Vehicle Recharge Bunk

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

With the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) as a cornerstone of future smart city designs, the accessibility and strategic placement of EV charging stations are paramount. Ensuring that EVs can conveniently find and utilize these charging stations is essential for seamless urban mobility and long-distance travel.
